Hi, I'm Julia Wood and I will be the data visualization specialist for our team. Besides data visualization, I will also conduct data analysis and help put our website together. I am really looking forward to working on this project because I am passionate about protecting our oceans, reversing climate change, and uncovering spatial trends using web mapping! <br/><br/><br/>
