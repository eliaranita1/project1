Hi, I'm Julia Wood and I will be the data visualization specialist for our team. Besides data visualization, I will also conduct data analysis and help put our website together. /n/n





**Overview**: Introduce the group project by stating what it is that you are investigating, and why this is a matter of importance.

**Methodology**: Introduce web mapping as a methodology of inquiry, and explain why this medium was chosen.

**Workflow**: Provide a workflow diagram/table that outlines the steps/phases the project will take from start to completion. Include dates/weeks as milestones.

**Technical scope**: Introduce the technologies that project will use (Git, Leaflet, HTML, Javascript, etc) and what role each one will play (a diagram might be helpful)

**Data**: Introduce at least two datasets that will be included in the project (include links as necessary). Make sure the data is "mappable" either by manual data entry, through an API, or by downloading it.
