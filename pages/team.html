        <h3>Our mission this quarter is to analyze plastic pollutants in the ocean.
             According to George Leonard, the chief scientist at the Ocean Conservancy,
              “At least half of [...ocean plastic waste] is not consumer plastics,
               which are central to much of the current debate, but fishing gear.” 
               This fact surprised our team and inspired us to look deeper into the connection
                between the fishing industry and plastic in the ocean.</h3>

        <h3>In recent years, individuals have been switching out their water bottles and plastic bags
             for resuable alternatives. More and more people are aware of their personal impact on the
              environment and actively work to minimize their carbon footprint. 
        
        However, what many people do not know is that the fishing industry is
         the biggest contributor of large plastics in the ocean, with fishing gear
          making up about "70 percent of plastics more than 20 centimeters (approximately 8 inches)
           large floating on the ocean's surface" (Greenpeace).
        
        Our team aims to investigate international fishing patterns and fishing activity translates
         to plastic pollution in our oceans.</h3>
