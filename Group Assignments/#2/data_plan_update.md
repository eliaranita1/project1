## Part 1: Data Plan Update

We have decided to narrow down our data down to these datasets:

1. Plastic Data Set: Estimate of Plastic Pollution in the World's Ocean [link](https://arc-gis-hub-home-arcgishub.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/schools-BE::estimate-of-plastic-pollution-in-the-world-s-oceans-1-01-4-75?geometry=-118.091%2C-54.081%2C-157.467%2C50.378) 
    1. Years: 2007-2013
2. Fishing Data Set: Global Datasets of AIS-based Fishing Effort and Vessel Presence [link](https://globalfishingwatch.org/data-download/datasets/public-fishing-effort) 
    1. Years: 2012-2020
    2. Note: The fishing data set comes from Global Fishing Watch, and you have to make an account to access the data. 
    3. Description: This dataset contains the Global Fishing Watch AIS-based fishing effort and vessel presence datasets. Data is based on fishing detections of >114,000 unique AIS devices on fishing vessels, of which ~70,000 are active each year. Fishing vessels are identified via a neural network classifier, vessel registry databases, and manual review by GFW and regional experts. Data are binned into grid cells 0.01 (or 0.1) degrees on a side and measured in units of hours. The time is calculated by assigning an amount of time to each AIS detection (which is the time to the previous position), and then summing all positions in each grid cell. 
3. Ocean Protected Zone Data Set [link](https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/search-areas?filters%5Bdb_type%5D%5B%5D=wdpa&filters%5Bis_type%5D%5B%5D=marine)
 






We will use our data to -(ex. "Data will be downloaded as a csv file from link and geocoded using Pytho

 Each category of data by fieldname will be a separate layer on the map assigned with a different color icon, and toggles will allow users to turn them on/off. Narratives will be driven by combining fieldnames and be available as a popup box as users hover over individual icons.")
