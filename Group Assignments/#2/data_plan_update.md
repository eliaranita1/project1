## Part 1: Data Plan Update

We have decided to narrow down our data down to these datasets:
* Link 1 
* Link 2
* Mismanaged Plastic Waste: https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution </br>
We will use this dataset to illustrate which countries are not managing their plastic waste properly, which allows plastic waste to enter the ocean via inland waterways, wastewater outflows, or by wind/tides.

We will use our data to -(ex. "Data will be downloaded as a csv file from link and geocoded using Pytho

 Each category of data by fieldname will be a separate layer on the map assigned with a different color icon, and toggles will allow users to turn them on/off. Narratives will be driven by combining fieldnames and be available as a popup box as users hover over individual icons.")
