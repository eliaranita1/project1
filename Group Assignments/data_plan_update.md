## Part 1: Data Plan Update

We have decided to narrow down our data down to these datasets:
* Link 1 
* Link 2

We will use our data to -(ex. "Data will be downloaded as a csv file from link and geocoded using Pytho

 Each category of data by fieldname will be a separate layer on the map assigned with a different color icon, and toggles will allow users to turn them on/off. Narratives will be driven by combining fieldnames and be available as a popup box as users hover over individual icons.")
