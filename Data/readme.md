### Our Datasets:

1. Plastic Data Set: Estimate of Plastic Pollution in the World's Ocean link
    1. Years: 2007-2013
2. Fishing Data Set: Global Datasets of AIS-based Fishing Effort and Vessel Presence link
    1. Years: 2012-2020
    2. Note: The fishing data set comes from Global Fishing Watch, and you have to make an account to access the data.
    3. Description: This dataset contains the Global Fishing Watch AIS-based fishing effort and vessel presence datasets. Data is based on fishing detections of >114,000 unique AIS devices on fishing vessels, of which ~70,000 are active each year. Fishing vessels are identified via a neural network classifier, vessel registry databases, and manual review by GFW and regional experts. Data are binned into grid cells 0.01 (or 0.1) degrees on a side and measured in units of hours. The time is calculated by assigning an amount of time to each AIS detection (which is the time to the previous position), and then summing all positions in each grid cell.
3. Ocean Protected Zone Data Set link
4. Mismanaged Plastic Waste link
    1. We will use this supplemental dataset to illustrate which countries are not managing their plastic waste properly, which allows plastic waste to enter the ocean via inland waterways, wastewater outflows, or by wind/tides. We will also use this data to construct bar charts to show which countries are the greatest contributors.
